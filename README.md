Hide News Feed
============

Hides the Facebook newsfeed. I call this "soft-quitting" or "soft-deactivating", in that you can access all other non-time-wasting features of Facebook without deactivating your account.

## Installation instructions

1. To install, go to the [Releases section](https://github.com/Kortaggio/HideNewsFeed/releases) and download the binary HideNewsFeed.crx
2. Open the "Extensions" tab in Google Chrome
3. Drag and drop the file you just downloaded into the Google Chrome extensions window
