Hide News Feed
============

Hides the Facebook newsfeed. I call this "soft-quitting" or "soft-deactivating", in that you can access all other non-time-wasting features of Facebook without deactivating your account.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Direct Download
[Click Here](https://github.com/billmei/HideNewsFeed/releases/download/v1.2.1/HideNewsFeed.1.2.1.crx) for a link to version 1.2.1

Drag and drop the downloaded `.crx` file into Google Chrome's "extensions" tab.

### 2. Binary File
Go to the releases section and download the latest `crx` file. After you are finished downloading this file (it should be named something like `HideNewsFeed.version.number.crx`), drag and drop it into Google Chrome's "extensions" tab. Tested on Chrome version 20+.

### 3. Compile From Source
Run

	$ git clone https://github.com/billmei/HideNewsFeed.git

Open Google Chrome and go to Settings -> Extensions (or go to `chrome://extensions`). Check the box on the top-right to enable Developer Mode. In the toolbar that appears, click on Load Unpacked Extension then select the folder `HideNewsFeed/Chrome Extension/`.
